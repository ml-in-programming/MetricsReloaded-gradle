        Calculates the degree of method inheritance in a project.
        Essentially, it gives the ratio of
        what percentage of the available methods on an average class are due
        to inheritance, rather than
        directly defined on the class. Methods inherited from library
        classes are not used in the calculation of
        this metric.
