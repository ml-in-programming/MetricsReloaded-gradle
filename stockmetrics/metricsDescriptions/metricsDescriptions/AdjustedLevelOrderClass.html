        Calculates the adjusted level order of a class. The
        adjusted level order is defined as 0
        for classes which are dependent on no other project classes. Classes
        with
        dependencies have level order equal to the maximum level order of
        their dependency classes,
        plus the number of classes on which they have mutual or cyclic
        dependencies. Conceptually,
        the adjusted level order measure how many "layers" of software a
        class or interface depends on,
        highlighting especially those with cyclic dependencies. Classes with
        large adjusted
        level orders may be difficult to test and maintain.
