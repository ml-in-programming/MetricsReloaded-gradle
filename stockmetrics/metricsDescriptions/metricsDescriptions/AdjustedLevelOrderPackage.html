        Calculates the adjusted level order of a packages. The
        adjusted level order is defined as 0
        for packages which are dependent on no other project packages.
        Packages with
        dependencies have level order equal to the maximum level order of
        their dependency packages,
        plus the number of packages on which they have mutual or cyclic
        dependencies. Conceptually,
        the adjusted level order measure how many "layers" of software a
        package depends on,
        highlighting especially those with cyclic dependencies. Packages
        with large adjusted
        level orders may be difficult to test and maintain.
